# 🧬 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Build a predictive model to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant using cell nucleus diagnostic measurements from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Violin Plots, Correlation Heatmaps, Pairplots
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Feature Importance Analysis

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Features like radius_mean, concavity_mean, and area_mean were top predictors of malignancy.
- Random Forest achieved strong accuracy and recall in detecting malignant cases.
- Diagnostic features offer strong predictive power for early detection support systems.
