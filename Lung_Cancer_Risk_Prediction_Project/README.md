# 🩺 Lung Cancer Risk Prediction – Survey Data Analysis

## 📌 Objective
Analyze behavioral and medical survey data to identify factors influencing lung cancer and build a machine learning model to predict lung cancer risk.

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Violin plots, pair plots, heatmaps
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classification
- Feature Importance Analysis

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Smoking, alcohol, and chronic disease are top contributing factors.
- Fatigue, coughing, and wheezing strongly associate with lung cancer.
- Age group and gender influence risk distribution.
- Random Forest achieved better classification performance than logistic regression.
