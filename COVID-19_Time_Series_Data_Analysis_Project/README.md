# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Time Series Project

## 📌 Objective
Analyze global COVID-19 case data to track infection trends, identify regional impacts, and support health policy planning through data-driven insights.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** Johns Hopkins University (JHU)
- **File:** `time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv`
- **Description:** Contains cumulative daily confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, with location-level granularity.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

### 🔹 Data Collection
- Imported the COVID-19 confirmed case dataset.
- Verified column structure and data accuracy.

### 🔹 Data Exploration
- Tracked global and country-wise infection growth.
- Identified high-risk and high-impact regions.
- Summarized top affected countries by confirmed case counts.

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Converted date columns to proper datetime format.
- Transformed wide format to long format for time-series analysis.
- Filled missing values and aggregated regional data.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Line Charts:** Visualized worldwide daily cumulative trends.
- **Heatmaps:** Showed region-wise spread intensity.
- **Monthly Trends:** Identified waves and growth spikes.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **Top Impacted Countries:** USA, India, Brazil, Russia, UK.
- **Wave Patterns:** Notable surges in 2020, mid-2021, and early 2022.
- **Regional Observations:** Higher growth in densely populated or urbanized areas.
- **Limitations:** Dataset only contains confirmed cases — does not include testing rates, recoveries, or deaths.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
- The COVID-19 pandemic followed clear wave patterns globally.
- Insights from infection growth trends can assist governments in:
  - Planning targeted interventions
  - Allocating resources
  - Improving healthcare preparedness

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Enhance data accuracy by merging with recovery, death, and vaccination datasets.
- Create real-time dashboards for public health officials and policy makers.
- Include socio-demographic and mobility data for more granular insights.
